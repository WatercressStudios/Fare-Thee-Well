    "Suddenly, I see light in the bleak midwinter."

    "A small town nestled deep in the woods."

    "Asleep, dreaming the passage of time."

    "All except for one single brick building, its windows, glowing with light, beacons for the lost."

    "I see it's a bar. A dimply lit sign flickers above the entrance. On it is a name emblazoned in pale golden letters."

    "'The Hearth and Home.'"

    "It'll do."

    "I push past the door and enter in out of the snowy night."

    "Once inside I take off my gloves and rub my hands together for warmth. It takes too long to feel my fingers again."

    "I close my tired eyes and take in the sounds of the bar. It's busier than I'd expect in a town like this."

    "There's a low murmur dispersed in the air. Some people are here in groups and many are, like me, alone."

    "It's good to see people again."

    "I slip my gloves into my coat and take a seat. A bartender spots me from behind a row of drying glasses and approaches."

    wan "A beer, please."

    "I only order it so I can stay."

    "The bartender fills a glass from the tap."

    ten "Traveling through?"

    "He places the drink in front of me. The liquid in the glass shines like oil under the pale, mellow lights of the bar."

    wan "Yeah."

    "I drink it all at once. It brings some fire back into my blood."

    ten "Can't say I know what business brought you here."

    wan "How do you know I'm not traveling for pleasure?"

    ten "Pleasure doesn't come this far north this time of year."

    "I smirk."

    wan "Maybe I got lost."

    ten "Maybe you did."

    "He takes my glass and steps away."

    "I take a glance out the window while he's gone. The night is black and thick with snow."

    "I should stay awhile longer. It won't let up soon."

    "Cedar, Maine. Population... a little over two thousand. I was able to make out the sign off the highway exit before the storm got too bad."

    "Originally I'd meant to make it all the way to the other side. Hitchhiking got harder after sunset. When it got too cold to be outside, I headed off the road to the nearest place I could find."

    "This place wasn't too bad. Reminded me of simpler times. I'll stay here for the night. Not that I have a choice."

    "It feels nice just to sit for a change. Sometimes you move so much you feel like you're not the one moving anymore."

    "Like you're drifting."

    "Sometimes, though, it's fine. When I can just stop and let things pass me by."

    "After a while I notice a change in the air. The curtain of small talk lowers into silence — the clinking of plates and glasses melts away."

    "A small crowd begins to form in one corner of the bar. I walk over to get a look at what's going on and watch as someone gets up onto a small unlit stage."

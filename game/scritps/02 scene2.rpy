    "The girl gazes with her deep brown eyes at the expectant faces all around her."
    
    "A hush falls over the crowd as she leans into the microphone. Her face betrays not a single emotion but pure wonder."
    
    "Like she's somewhere else, remembering better times, preparing to sing to herself in a world that stood still to hang off her every word."

    "After her rendition of Loch Lomond, the girl continues to perform, singing various other folk songs. The audience continues to be mesmerized by every movement of her parted lips — the bar is eerily silent, and not a single person dare move."

    "Her voice is magical. The most beautiful I've heard in all my life."

    "I've never been this absorbed in song before."

    "The voice of the girl in the green dress grows, and grows, and grows, only to fill the air with complete emotion, feelings seething with energy."

    "Like her voice is an endless flowing spring, and to listen to it is to drink, and drink, and drink again."

    "I've never felt this way before."

    "I doubt I will again."

    "When she finally finishes her set, the girl in the green dress takes a fateful step back from the microphone."

    "Her skin beads with sweat. Her chest heaves up and down to the rhythmic beat of her exhausted heart."

    "Her posture is tired, but proud. Her breath short, but steady. Her eyes somber, but bright, vibrant with fire."

    "And as I watch her, in this precious little moment of silence, it seems all time stops."

    "The sheer intensity of this moment breaks over me like a cold ocean wave. The sadness I feel at its impermanence — its immediate beginning and end — pulls me under."

    "I am washed in fascination, and in that moment, the passage of time resumes. It flows unhindered, ignorant that so much change had just taken place in my inner self in that brief window of frozen time."

    "Of that change in my heart that has just set forth in motion a long, long story."

    "One that will not end for a very long time."

    "A story about meeting people, and saying goodbye to people."

    "A story about arrivals and departures."

    "A story about time."

    "He takes a look around the bar as he wipes some washed plates. The sink isn't too far from my seat, and he can talk to me while he works."

    ten "Busy night tonight."

    wan "Busier than usual?"

    ten "Much."

    "So even this counts as 'much busier than usual.' This must be an even smaller town than I'd thought."

    wan "The girl helps?"

    "The bartender nods knowingly."

    ten "Oh, the girl helps."

    wan "Is she a real singer?"

    ten "I suppose any singer's a real one. But no, she's not a professional. We could never afford someone like that."

    wan "Then what is she?"

    ten "She's young. About your age."

    "About my age."

    ten "One of those student types."

    "The bartender doesn't seem to take offense on my jab at his hometown."
    
    ten "Don't know. She's been in town about a month now. Stays in the motel across the bridge. Usually we don't have music, but she's willing to work for cheap."

    wan "She's good."

    ten "She's affordable."

    "I take a sip of my beer. From the bartender's description, the girl in the green dress seems interesting."

    "I'd like to talk to her, if I can."

    wan "You let people talk to her after her sets?"

    "He seems incredibly unsurprised."

    ten "No, but you seem like a nice enough guy, so go ahead. I'll warn you though, no one's lasted long in a conversation with her."

    "I take a bigger sip and cock my head."

    wan "Why's that?"

    ten "Seems to be she's an ice queen. She's polite enough. Just doesn't say very much. Doesn't want to open up to anyone about anything. That kind of girl."

    wan "What, a bar singer who's too shy to talk to people?"

    ten "In the flesh."

    "Of all the thoughts that crossed my mind while she was onstage, I didn't once imagine her to be shy."

    "It must take a lot of courage to get up there and sing. So she's brave on the outside, but what's on the inside? What makes her shy?"

    "There must be something hidden in all this."

    "...I'm far too interested to back out now."

    "I finish off my drink to the last drop."

    "I take out some money and tuck it under my glass as payment and stand up from my seat."

    ten "Your sacrifice will be remembered throughout all northern Maine."

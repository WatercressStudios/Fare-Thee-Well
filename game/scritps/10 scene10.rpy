    # Michael and Rosa Enter

    mic "Hey guys, this is Rosa."
    
    "After some quick introductions, Candace makes everyone drinks."

    can "These are on the house!"

    "We all cheer for Candace's hospitality together."

    ros "Thank you Candace, that's too kind of you."

    "I listen in as the other three around the table share their stories, occasionally pitching in my own experiences."

    "Michael and Rosa are fast friends, and by the end of the first hour, the pair get along as if they'd known each other all their lives."

    "The bar's patrons dwindle until we are the only people left in the building, but even after everyone else has gone, we stay, sharing stories of loss and of hope, of dreams and regrets."

    "Rosa begins to tell her story, and her eyes light up with a childlike happiness."

    ros "When I was younger, all I ever wanted to do was go to school to study music. It has always been my passion. So I worked at it, from the time I first saw a future in it, until I had realized the dream."

    ros "But..."

    "The light in her eyes fades into a quiet sadness."

    ros "When I finally made it to music school, it was..."

    ros "It just didn't feel right. I had worked so hard, for so long. Year after year, but the culmination of my entire childhood led me to disappointment."

    ros "But I was still determined. Never mind that I couldn't seem to make any friends or do well in my classes; music was still my passion, so everything else be damned."

    "Rosa wipes a tear from her cheek."

    ros "For all of my effort and determination, halfway through my first year, I dropped out. I hit rock bottom."

    ros "I've hated myself for quitting, but I never saw an alternative. I wasn't happy, and I'm sure as hell not happy now, but I'm better than I was."

    ros "So I can say with certainty that I don't regret making that decision. What I'm unsure about is where I'm going now."

    ros "All I have is my music and the will to keep moving forward. So since leaving school, I've been travelling wherever the music takes me. I hope that it can one day lead me to true happiness."
    
    ros "I guess, for now, I'm just along for the ride."

    "Candace raises her glass."

    can "Well hell, I'll drink to that."

    "Rosa nods gratefully to Candace and turns to Michael."

    mic "I guess I could say I understand some of those feelings. I finished school, but it hasn't really done me much good. As soo as I graduated, I came right back home to Cedar."

    mic "And I didn't just come back for my mother. Of course I had to, given her health these days, but even if she were in good health, I know I'd still be back here."

    mic "I kind of feel like I'm in some kind of void, stuck between childhood and true adulthood. Something is holding me back, but I don't know what it is."

    mic "And I can't, for the life of me, figure out why."

    "The idea that Michael was drawn back to Cedar makes me chuckle."

    wan "In my experience, getting away from Cedar's one hell of a task. Not that Cedar is a bad place, mind you, it just has this..."

    wan "This pull, for lack of a better word."

    "Candace nods in agreement."

    can "Cedar's always been good to me and mine."

    "Candace waves a hand over her shoulder, motioning to the empty Hearth and Home."

    can "This ol' girl's been in the family for four generations now. My father, grandad, and great grandad all put their lives into this place, and I'll be damned if I don't do the same."

    can "But this life isn't for everyone. Maybe you just need to broaden your horizons? See more of what's out there?"

    "Michael considers this for a moment."

    mic "Maybe. But I haven't really felt like my life ever needed to start somewhere else."

    can "Then what are you missing, Mike?"

    "Michael slumps in defeat."

    mic "I honestly don't know."

    "Out of the three of them, I can relate most to Rosa. She seems to feel like there isn't a place where she belongs. Even so, I can sympathize with Michael and Candace."

    "But, unlike myself or Rosa, Candace is very deeply rooted here in Cedar. Though I've grown to consider her a close friend, we're about as different as different can get."

    "Michael reminds me of Emmeline, which, of course, comes as no surprise. He likes his life in Cedar, but he's mindful of his future and where it might take him."

    "I look up from my empty glass, which I had been absent mindedly been turning over in my hand, and catch Rosa's eye. She curiously meets my gaze."

    ros "So how about you? Do you have any grandiose dreams or aspirations? Any miserable failures that landed you where you are now?"

    wan "Hah, yeah. Quite a few more than I can count at this point."

    "She narrows her eyes in suspicion. Clearly I've piqued her interest."
    
    wan "I used to be a lot like you, looking for somewhere I could belong, going wherever the road took me. There's nothing wrong with that; no shame in it whatsoever. It takes time to discover who you are, to find out who you want to be."

    ros "So what advice can you give?"

    wan "Advice? I hardly think I'm qualified to be giving advice to anyone."

    ros "I'm not concerned with qualifications. I just want to hear what a similar mind has to tell me."

    wan "In that case, the best thing I can offer you is this:"

    wan "The belonging that you're searching for Â­ you may never find it. Where circumstances different, I might still be searching for it. What you can do that will make all the difference is really quite simple."

    wan "Life is going to go on, regardless of what you do. Don't just let it happen. Take charge of your own life. Even though you may not find what you search for, it will make that search easier."

    "I've always had trouble putting this into words. It's been in the back of my mind for as long as I can remember, but words always seem to fail me."

    wan "I guess what I'm trying to say is that you aren't going to find what you're looking for if you are so caught up in your search that you can't see what's in front of you."

    "Rosa sits back in her chair, looking rather confused."

    wan "I'm sorry if that doesn't make sense. I'm not the best with speaking my thoughts."

    "She shakes her head."

    ros "No, I think I understand."

    "Candace laughs her usual laugh."

    can "Hah! I have no idea what you just said, but I know you're probably right."

    can "Anyhow, it looks like we could all use another round. I'll be right back."

    # Candace Leaves

    "As Candace goes to retrieve our drinks, my thoughts wander to Emmeline, as they so often do."

    wan "Tell me, Michael, how is Emmeline doing these days?"

    "A lone vocalist in a blue dress takes the stage at The Hearth and Home."

    "She appears to be close to Michael's age, who is now twenty-four."

    "The young woman begins singing, and the the meager audience is immediately captivated."

    ros "If I had wings like Noah's dove, I'd fly the river to the one I love. Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well."

    "Across the bar stand the current employees of The Hearth and Home, Candace and Michael, who has taken the job his mother once held to help pay for his education."

    "Candace and I are having a lovely conversation, but Michael's unwavering attention is set on the young performer."

    can "Hey, Michael?"

    "Candace tries to grab her employee's attention, but has little success."

    can "Mike? Hello in there?"

    "Candace gives a defeated sigh, and waves a hand in front of Michael's face, jolting him back to reality."

    mic "Oh, uh, sorry Candace. What did you need?"

    "Candace laughs at the young man. She's clearly embarrassed him, so it's no surprise that his face has become several shades redder than some of the wines behind the bar."

    can "Table four was waving you down for refills. Get out there, bud."

    mic "Oh, right. I'm on it."

    "Michael prepares several mugs of draft beer, loads them onto a tray, and heads out to the floor. All the while, he pays only minimal attention to his task, still smitten by the young singer."

    can "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"

    wan "No, it's alright."

    "Michael returns from his waiting duties. Candace gives him a good long stare, and he blushes again."

    can "I know she's pretty, but please do try to pay attention to our patrons, okay?"

    mic "Yes, ma'am. I mean, uh, no - uh…"

    "Candace laughs the way her father used to sometimes laugh - with her entire body, hands on her stomach and leaning back."

    "Michael turns away from his boss, and back to the singer."

    "The young performer begins the last verse of her song."

    ros "I remember one night, in the drizzling rain, around my heart I felt an aching pain, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well."

    "The song's end is met with a quiet, yet suitable applause."

    "I feel reminiscent about my similar experience in the very same bar thirty-five years prior, and smile in spite of myself. I propose an idea to the young man across the bar."

    wan "Why don't you buy her a drink after she finishes her set?"

    mic "That's ridiculous. I can't do that! I don't even know her."

    can "And how could asking possibly hurt? Besides, you don't need to know her to become friends."

    mic "I'm nothing more than a stranger to her though…"

    can "Ha! Now /that/ is ridiculous. As my father would say, strangers are just friends you haven't met yet."

    mic "But what if-"

    wan "Mike, you can make excuses till the sun comes up and you're blue in the face. Or you can ask the lady to have a drink with you."

    "Michael stops his protesting and considers the words his companions have shared with him."

    "For a moment, he looks as though he plans to ignore the advice he has received; however, one quick glance at Candace and I confirm that no is not an option."

    mic "I guess you guys aren't giving me a choice, huh?"

    can "Absolutely not! Now then-"

    can "Let's talk strategy!"

    "Candace and I share a laugh while Michael looks on, terrified at the prospect of whatever scheme Candace has in store."

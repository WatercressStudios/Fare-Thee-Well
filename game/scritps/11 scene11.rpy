    "Hours pass, and it's clear that we've all reached our limit. The clock behind the bar reads three-thirty­six."

    ros "My goodness, I hadn't realized how late — well, early — it's gotten. I really should be going."

    "Rosa stands and puts on her coat."

    ros "Thank you all for a wonderful evening. I'm truly grateful."

    mic "Rosa, would you mind if I walked you back to your motel?"

    "Candace sneaks a wink and a thumbs­up in my direction. I can't help but grin."

    ros "Well, okay. That's very nice of you to offer."

    "As the two prepare to leave, Candace begins to clean up while I lean back in my chair and stretch my tired bones."

    mic "I just wanted to thank you. Tonight has been one of the most memorable nights of my life, and it's all thanks to your encouragement."
    
    wan "There's no need to thank me. We all had a good time."

    "I think it's time I left Cedar. I've spent more time in this little town than I'd intended to. It's the first time I ever came back somewhere."

    "But now, it's time I move on. Life will go on here, just as it always has. My journey is far from finished. This place has taught me a lot, and I'd like to think I've given something back."

    "Though no other place will ever quite fill the gap Cedar will doubtlessly leave in my life, I chose to make Cedar a part of me, and I wouldn't trade that for anything."

    mic "Maybe I don't need to thank you, but let me anyway. You've always been a good friend to me; let me do the same for you."

    "Michael extends his hand to me, and I take it in mine. We exchange a handshake, meaningful to each of us in different ways."

    mic "Thank you."

    "Goodbye, Michael."

    "I take a long look around the cozy bar I've become so familiar with."

    "I see the tables and the booths where Candace's loyal patrons gather after a long day's work."

    "I see the bar, where I first met Candace, and her father before her."

    "I close my eyes and breath in the familiar scents of pine, fire, and alcohol."

    "I will surely miss Cedar. I'll miss The Hearth and Home. I'll miss Candace, Michael, and now Rosa. I'll miss Emmeline."

    "I will miss them all, but I will never forget them."

    "I stand and walk over to the coat rack, which sits beside the door. My coat is now hanging alone."

    "After putting my coat on, I start out the door, but am quickly halted by the length of a broomstick being thrust in front of me."

    can "About two hours ago, I figured this would be your last night in Cedar."

    can "Before you go, there's something you need to see."

    wan "Well, what is it?"

    can "Come with me."

    "Candace takes me by the arm and leads me behind the bar, through a door, and down a flight of stairs into the wine cellar."

    "She reaches to an empty section of the wine rack, and produces a large sealed envelope."

    can "There's a chair over there. Take as much time as you need."

    "She hands me the envelope and walks over to the door."

    "Candace turns back to me. She looks sad for a brief moment, but then smiles again."

    can "It's been fun. Thank you."

    "Without another word, she turns once more, closing the door behind her."

    "Goodbye, Candace."

    "I sit down in Candace's chair and look at the envelope in my hands."

    "I run my hand across its smooth surface, wondering what this is."

    "Carefully, I tear open the envelope at its seal."

    "Inside are three smaller envelopes, each marked with a date, 1967, 1987, and 2002."

    "I start with the envelope labeled 1967. Inside is a letter, handwritten."

    "The handwriting is excellent and unmistakably feminine."

    # Letter 1967

    n "To my dearest stranger,"

    n "Two nights ago, you swooped into my life. You shared with me the best night of my life, and then you were gone, with more mystery than your arrival."

    n "For the few hours we spent together, all seemed to be right in the world. All my cares had gone away. It was truly blissful. And then you left so suddenly, so abruptly. You never even said goodbye. The magic dissipated instantly. My bliss shattered, leaving only pain and confusion."

    n "That night that we shared, why did we share it? Why did you come into my life, if only to leave hours later? Please don't misunderstand me, dear stranger, I'm not angry. I hold nothing against you. I only wish I could understand why that night happened. I was sure that we were both so happy, but when you left, I began to have doubts."

    n "Had I done something wrong? Were you not happy, as I thought you to be? Of course, thinking back to it now, it all seems a bit silly. It was one night, nothing gained and nothing lost. I'm sure you had your reasons for leaving. I'm glad it happened. I will always remember it."

    n "However, dear stranger, should I ever see you again, though it seems doubtful, please help me to understand what that night meant. I have an aching desire to know."

    n "To be honest, I'm not sure that you will ever read this letter, but I take comfort in knowing that it will not matter if you read it or not. This letter doesn't really mean anything. All I have written here is just the result of one impossible yet undeniable experience. The ramblings of a young woman."

    n "My dear stranger, I wrote all of this to ask for an explanation, but it is now clear to me that I will never receive one. You don't owe it to me, so please don't feel as though you do. I'm happy enough to keep the memories of that night precious without anything more."

    n "So, my stranger, although you never said it yourself, I will say it now."

    n "Goodbye, dear stranger,"

    n "Emmeline"

    n "My dear Wanderer,"

    n "I will write to you once again, and this will be my last."
 
    n "I have grown old and feeble, but alas, you are just as I remember you from all those years ago. I'm sorry that you'll never be able to grow old. My life, my son and my family, they have given me joy, just as the night we spent together so long ago did."

    n "Candace has been filling me in on all the fun I've been missing, so I'm grateful to her for that. I trust that she'll deliver these letters to you, when the time is right."

    n "We've had our suspicions for a while now, that you would probably leave Cedar soon. It always makes me sad, thinking of your inevitable departure. It's kind of strange. We've spent so little time together in our lives, but it seems like that timeis so very significant."
    
    n "Over all these years, there hasn't been a day that I haven't thought back to the night we first met. I never have been able to understand why, it's just always meant a lot to me."
    
    n "I did recognize you when you came back in '87, though not right away. I'm not really sure why I didn't ever say anything to you. It just never felt like there was a good time to say anything. You had lived twenty more years. I had gotten twenty years older. I got married and had Michael. Looking back, it was for the best that I did not say anything."

    n "It's a strange thing, the connection we seem to have. I would say it is unique, but I can't say for certain whether that is true or not."

    n "The time you were a part of my life was indeed brief, but, without a doubt, that time changed my life. It changed my view of the world, and it changed how I see other people. I'm uncertain, but I think these changes were for the better, so I thank you."

    n "I also want to thank you for leaving me that night. I've enjoyed my normal life; I see now that this is all I ever could have wanted. You saw that it was what I wanted long before I ever even wanted it. You showed me something special, and you gave me the chance to live the life that was mine."

    n "My dearest Wanderer, we aren't very good at goodbyes, are we? But this will indeed be our last. But I have grandchildren that I soon hope to meet, and you have a long road ahead of you, so I'll keep it brief."

    n "I want you to remember me as who I was and, to you, will now always be."

    n "So goodbye, my dear Wanderer."

    n "Travel safe. Travel far and long and wide."

    n "And maybe, in another life ­ in a different time ­ we will meet again."

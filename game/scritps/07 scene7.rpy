    "June 13, 1987"

    "Another day, another highway stretches out towards Oblivion, USA as I stand beside it, outstretched arm, erected thumb, baking in the heat of the mid-June sun like a scrambled egg served sunny side-up over asphalt."

    "Route 1 to be exact, some meaningless measure of distance from Caribou. These old Maine roads are so familiar, painfully so, that I attempt to suspend my awareness of them as I walk from one town to the next." 
    
    "Too many memories spanning too many years. I’m growing tired; mentally, physically, spiritually—hell, every which way a man can grow weary." 

    "But still, year after year I walk these same old roads. Maybe one day I’ll just stop dead cold in my tracks, and the good Lord’ll allow me to finally rest on some dusty trail in the middle of nowhere."

    "Perhaps they’ll even name it after me… that wouldn’t be so bad, being memorialized for future generations of ramblers like myself."
    
    "But now I can’t walk anymore; it’s been hours since I left Caribou and I’ve gotta piss like there’s no tomorrow."

    "I issue a prayer under my breath."
    
    "Why? I don’t know, as there’s surely no one out here to hear it but myself." 

    "I hope that some friendly stranger with a penchant for helping other friendly strangers might notice my hiked thumb and offer me a lift to the next town."

    "My prayer is soon answered in the form of an eighteen-wheeler. Zimmerman Trucking Co., if I can correctly decipher the eroded letters emblazoned on the side of the truck."
    
    "Its driver leans over the passenger seat and struggles for several moments to get the window to roll down, but to little avail. This truck has clearly seen better days." 

    "One exasperated grunt later, he accepts that his passenger-side window will not budge down further than a crack." 

    "Fortunately this is just enough of an opening for him to be able to shout and be heard above the rumble and sputter of his idling engine."

    tru "Hey man, where ya headed?!"

    wan "Anywhere’s fine so long as I can get out of this heat!"

    "A moment later the truck’s passenger-side door swings open, and I gratefully climb up into the well air-conditioned cab."
    
    "The interior smells of cigarettes, whiskey, and grease, each scent hitting me in turn as I buckle myself in; it’s nostalgic, though it really shouldn’t be."

    "The driver, all slender and short and clean-shaven, the very opposite of the big, burly type that you always imagine drive big rigs for a living, thrusts a hand in my direction, which I take and shake firmly."

    tru "So anywhere’s fine, eh?"

    "His shortened ‘o’ sound and use of ‘eh’ places his origin somewhere in the Midwest, probably Minnesota, but there’s a foreign element to it, almost a southern twang."

    wan "Yessir, and I do thank you for the lift. A moment longer out there and I’d likely have succumbed to a heat stroke… or worse."

    tru "Worse?"

    wan "Melting."

    tru "Ha! Yeah man, it sure is a scorcher, isn’t it? Highest temperature on record for this region, or so the weatherman said on the radio this morning."

    tru "Global warming is what they’re calling it."

    tru "I don’t know about all that, but I do know it sure ain’t the right weather for hitch-hiking."

    wan "You can say that again."

    tru "Anyway, this old rig’s heading up to St. Leonard, but you just let me know if you wanna be dropped off anywhere  along the way." 

    tru "Not that there’s much to speak of between here and there, haha."

    wan "Nah, Canada is fine. In fact, anywhere’s better than…"

    "I pause to consider just where the hell I am. This ribbon of highway which leads north out of Caribou just meanders through unincorporated countryside, really."

    "Grassy plains and clusters of trees everywhere you look. A short distance away I spy a small farm that wasn’t there a decade ago."

    "An old man is listlessly riding a lawnmower over well-trimmed grass. What else can he do to kill these mid-afternoon hours when everything is so hot and dry and dead?"

    wan "...nowhere, I guess."

    "The man laughs and shifts the truck into gear, and soon we’re headed down Route 1, with only the radio to take my mind off of how full my bladder is."

    "It's tuned to some political program wherein two pundits are taking turns yelling lies at each other about Gorbachev and democracy."

    "A more unprincipled man might’ve taken a leak somewhere off the side of the road, but I could never do a thing like that." 

    "This land, with its deserts and trees and beaches and skyscrapers and hippie communes, is my land; the highways that are etched into its face are collectively my temple, and I am its high priest."

    "To wantonly piss on this holy ground would be no less than sacrilege."

    "(Innermost convictions be damned, though, if we don’t reach a truck stop or rest area soon. I would rather pee on a bush than myself.)"

    "On the radio there’s a lull in the heated discourse as one of the hosts segues into some recent soundbite of the President speaking."

    "{i}...across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth.{/i}"
    
    "The trucker’s interest appears piqued as he turns up the volume and listens intently."

    "{i}General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate.{/i}"

    "{i}Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall {/i}"

    "Old Gipper couldn’t outact a chimp, but he can sure put an end to communism, yessirree."

    "The driver soon loses interest as the program segues out of Reagan’s spiel and back to the two goofballs arguing about Gorbachev, and he begins to scan through whatever radio stations can be caught this far into Aroostook County."

    tru "Any preference?"

    "I let him skip through various rock and roll oldies stations before giving him the nod to stop the dial on Hank Williams’ ‘Lovesick Blues’."

    "I’m not the biggest country music fan, but listening to the Hillbilly Shakespeare wax poetic about being nobody’s sugar daddy anymore proves to be a pleasant enough distraction—at least until my trucking friend joins in with his own nasally intonations."

    "Fortunately a Texaco soon appears, and I’m spared the displeasure of hearing him butcher the rest of the tune as he pull in near the closest pump and steps outside to refuel."

    "As for me, I hasten to avail myself of the gas station’s public restroom. I purchase a cinnamon danish and an 8 oz. cup of coffee on my way out, and then it’s back on the road we go."

    "The danish is dry and crumbly—don’t know what I expected for 50 cents, to tell the truth—but the coffee is good, and I nurse it as I begin to ponder what I’ll do when I reach St. Leonard."

    scene highway with fade

    "There’s something about the flavor of cheap roadside coffee that’s intoxicating to the tired mind. Pretty soon I can feel my spirits begin to lift as my imagination runs amok thinking up adventures that might await me in St. Leonard."

    "This won’t be my first time in Canada, far from it, of course, but for whatever reason I’ve avoided seeing Quebec till now."

    "Maybe it’s because I don’t speak a damn lick of French, but then again, language barriers never kept me from having a little fun in the French Quarter either."

    "A passing mile marker reads 2,305. It won’t be too long now until we reach the border and I can begin a new life in a new town with a new job…" 

    "All for about two weeks before I have to move on and do the same old song and dance someplace else. I’m not complaining—because again, I’ve never been to French-speaking Canada."

    "St. Leonard will do me good. ...or so I’d like to believe."

    "But that honest part of me that I’ve become so adept at suppressing is nagging at my brain, reminding me in no subtle tone that there’s more between here and there than just open road."

    "An old, familiar ache suddenly reawakens as I gaze into the shallow pool of java that sits at the bottom of my cup. In the swirling pools of ochre I can see visions of a girl I once met, hallucinations of her chestnut hair wisping in the light winter breeze."

    "What possessed me to walk this way? What else did I think would come of going back to Maine? Not enough time has passed to dull my lingering sense of regret."

    "I mean, hell, twenty years is a long, long time… but in my life? That’s not long enough to exorcise the ghost of a single night."

    "It was the sort of night that never leaves you; even as a memory, it visits you in the evening when you’re trying to be quiet, trying to rest. It plays tricks on your mind, summoning apparitions from out of nowhere."

    "Even now, visions of that girl come to me when I least expect them; just when I think I’m ready to cancel all debts to my past self and press onward for once and for good, that’s when she comes to me."

    "These visions conquer my mind. They keep me coming back to old roads and old towns in hopes of seeing her again—even though I’m certain she wouldn’t remember me."

    "The truck suddenly jerks to a halt, causing the puddle of coffee I was just fixated on to splash in my face, putting a premature end to my sad, nostalgic spell."

    tru "Jesus, man, I’m so sorry! Are you alright?"

    wan "It was lukewarm anyway, so I’m cool. What’s happening?"

    "The man gestures beyond the windshield and I see a long stretch of cars ahead and beyond that, an accident of some sort. State trooper lights flash in the distance."

    "Seems they’re allowing only a few vehicles at a time to cautiously maneuver around the wreckage, and we’re the new end-of-the-line."

    "Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes slowly drip by, and in that time we’ve scarcely budged. Finally the fellow seated beside me lets out an exasperated sigh and reaches over to my side of the cab in order to fish something from out the glove compartment; I scoot my legs back to give him more room to sort through the stacks of loose tools and booklets."

    "After replacing a manual and a set of grease-stained gloves his bandaged hand at last returns with a well-worn copy of The Complete Works of Allen Ginsberg. Cat’s got taste."

    "As he slips on a pair of reading glasses and opens to some latter bookmarked page, I decide to whittle away the time with a book of a different kind: my journal. Reaching into the front compartment of my backpack, I remove the latest draft of my voluminous travelogue."

    "I like to think that one day this journal will be published to great acclaim, but as a work of fiction; Lord knows I’ve experienced too much crazy shit over the course of too many decades for anyone to buy into the veracity of its contents."

    "Then, some years afterward, it’ll be adapted to the silver screen as a musical buddy comedy starring Steve Martin and Dan Ackroyd. Kevin Bacon will cameo as yours truly. It’ll be mad fun, and it will all happen long after I finally decide to give up on this running joke of a life."

    "With a wistful sigh I open the record book of my eternal life on the road. There has got to be something in here that will pull me out of this funk and resuscitate those optimistic feelings I had but fifteen minutes ago. I begin flipping to random entries in search of what whatever that might be."

    #Wolf's part of scene 1

    "Let’s see..."

    "There was the period of about six years that I spent as a performer in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey travelling circus. This was back during the Great Depression, when I would have been lucky to find any work at all."

    "I started out as an animal trainer’s assistant—basically the schmuck that had to feed the animals and clean the shit out of their cages—and from there, moved on to a variety of jobs: from clown, to juggler, to tightrope walker, to trapeze artist, to sword swallower, to you name it. I did it all."

    "I mastered every skillset and performed every role that existed under the big top, until finally, one day, I was promoted to ringmaster by an old friend of mine, none other John Nicholas Ringling himself."

    "Sadly, he died the year afterward, and in my opinion the old circus was never the same. Once his nephew assumed ownership of the business is when everything started going south for me."

    "I didn’t so much mind that ticket prices went up, or that we were asked to make everything bigger and more dangerous for less pay; but when our standard two-week engagements became month-long, then two-months long engagements, I knew I had to leave."

    "With a heavy heart, I bid a silent farewell to my old flames: Carla, the acrobat, Regina, the animal tamer, and Catherine, the knife-thrower, along with all the hearts I’d broken along the old B&B circuit, and I never looked back."

    "Skipping ahead a few dozen pages…  ah, my affair with Lillian Hellman, the playwright. Lilly was accused of being a Communist sympathizer during the Second Red Scare of the early 50s and was under constant surveillance by FBI and Department of State. In addition to being spied on, she was being harassed by Anti-Soviet groups and had begun to fear for her safety."

    "Through a series of odd jobs and acquaintances, I became her bodyguard in March of 1951, when she went on a media tour of New York state to promote her newest play, The Autumn Garden. I would accompany her into every ritzy hotel room along the itinerary, where we’d often stay up till 2 AM or later sipping cognac and discussing politics."

    "Lilly’s political sympathies were very similar to mine, and I commiserated with her on her plight. It wasn’t long before she counted me among her many lovers."

    "Of course, the press tour eventually ended, and she returned to her home on Long Island. She invited me to come live with her. As always, the offer of having a place to call home and a friendly face to share it with was tempting beyond words."

    "I spent a few nights with her there, slept on a cot because I didn’t want to fall in too deep with her, then made up some bullshit story about having to go break things off with a girl in Queens; I never went back to the Island, never even saw Lillian Hellman again."

    "If someone were to ask me if she is writing plays or if she’s even still alive, I would have to say that I really don’t know."

    "As the traffic jam slowly diminishes, I read stories of peace and stories of protest; stories of love and stories of war; stories of freedom and stories of bondage. In all my life’s stories there’s a sick recurring theme: my own selfishness."

    "During high times and low times alike, I ingrained myself in the hearts of those around me. Though fate dictated that I should always keep moving, I always stuck around long enough to leave a lasting impression on one person or another."

    "In some ways I can’t help it. I’m not so much of an asshole that I would go out of my way to make everyone dislike me. I can’t simply abort that everyday mental process which keeps me trying to please others. I want to please others. I figured out a long time ago that what I want more than anything in this world is to be loved by everyone I meet."

    "So I keep travelling across this land, from one friend to another, from one lover to the next; like a merry-go-round, round and round I go, in perpetual motion, leaving a blur of discarded relationships behind me as I spin."

    "Though I’ve tried to slow things down since that fateful night, that holy night of repentance when I finally decided that I wasn’t going to hurt another loved one, that I was sick of vanishing from their lives with no explanation given… Christ, it’s 1987 and I’m still spinning."

    "This increasingly hellish ride I’ve spent the past several decades on is never going to end. Never. Not until I finally work up the courage to jump."

    "..."

    "I feel sick."

    "Looking up, I see we’re finally back en route to St. Leonard. A feeling of relief should be washing over me, but the opposite is true: instead, a sense of dread has befallen me."

    "Nothing good ever comes from reading my travelogue."

    "Someday, I hope, someone will find it and find inspiration and meaning in my collective experiences; for me, though, they only seem to bring pain. It is a book of painful truths, from cover to cover; I knew this yet decided to read it anyway."

    tru "Hey, man… you alright? You’re lookin’ kind of pale there."

    wan "Y… yeah. I guess… I guess that danish didn’t agree with me, heh."

    "I’ve got to get my mind on something else."

    tru "Oh, yeah. Those shitty little truck stop snacks’ll do that to ya, for sure."

    "I have to get it off of her."

    tru "Luckily for both of us, our stop is comin’ soon."

    "Stop, huh?"

    "Stop..."

    "...Of course. This truck is going to stop in St. Leonard, where I will settle into a motel for the night. I will look for employment the next day, and I will find it. I will stay in St. Leonard as long as I am able to, then I will move onto the next town."

    "I have all of Quebec to explore. It will be fun, and before I know it, these tormentous feelings will have passed."

    "..."

    "I reopen the book, this time not to a sad old story, but to my most recent, unfinished entry. I record that my visit to Spanish Harlem was fruitless, that the old gypsy palm reader that been my friend for so many decades had finally passed away; now no one knows my secret."

    "From Harlem I hitched a ride that took me all the way to Bangor, where I began to walk."

    nvl clear

    n "June 12-13"

    n "After about a week of walking US 1 and sleeping under the stars, I stopped in Caribou. Spent the night at a cheap motel, then went to barber for a shave and a haircut in the morning."

    n "Continued northward until I was picked up by a friendly truck driver."
    
    n "Headed for a town near the Canadian border called St. Emmeline."

    "..."

    "...Am I losing my mind?"

    "Was it madness that drove me to this specific part of Maine, or am I just a victim of fate?"

    "No, something tells me that it was more than just a simple twist of fate that brought me here. My feet have a mind of their own, and took me to this part of Maine of their own accord. They’ve tried to tell me for some time now that it’s time to settle down one last time, but I haven’t been listening."

    "Am I really going to do this? Am I really going to go back there after all these years?"

    "What would even be the point?"

    "No one will remember me."

    "She won’t remember me."

    "While I’ve been frittering away the past two decades, time has marched on for the good folks in Cedar, Maine. There’s just no point in going back there. I’m not ready to settle down."

    "I still have places I need to see, things I’ve got to do. For all my talk of being weary of my life on the road, I’m not ready to grow old and lose it."

    "Why can’t anyone understand that?"

    "I have to keep going."

    "I can’t stop for anything or anyone."

    "This dreadful feeling will pass once I’m in Canada, and everything will continue as it always had."

    tru "Talk about your jerkwater towns, man. Folks would forget that place existed if it weren’t on the map."

    "I look up to see what he’s referring to, and in the near distance there is a sign rapidly approaching: Cedar, 5 miles."

    "..."
    
    "I must be out of my mind."

    scene highway with fade

    tru "You sure you don’t wanna continue on to Canada?"

    wan "No, here’s fine. I… I sort of have some unfinished business in Cedar."

    "The trucker laughs and says that, from the way I had been acting ever since we were caught in that traffic jam, he figured I had changed my mind about St. Leonard."

    wan "I’m really grateful to for you for bring me this far. So, uh, so what do I owe you for the ride?"

    "I reach into my back to remove my wallet, but the trucker just shakes his head."

    tru "You’re just a wayfaring stranger like me. If the only difference between us is that I’ve got a vehicle and you don’t… God, what kind of person would I have been to pass you up? That’s why I never pass up hitch-hikers and will never charge one for a ride."

    wan "Are you sure?"

    "I really hate taking advantage of people’s kindness. The trucker smiles and offers me one last hearty laugh."

    tru "Man, don’t think twice, it’s alright."

    "..."

    # engine start, driving off sound effect

    "I turn to face a sign I thought I’d never see again; it reads ‘Cedar, Maine. Population: 2,501’. "

    "I think for a moment about what it might mean for me to venture beyond that sign—about all the risks involved in trying to see her again. Now that I’m finally here, I want nothing more than to just turn around and run back to the highway, where I’ve always belonged."

    "But I can’t. It was the spectre of her memory which drew me here, and it won’t let me run away again. For better or worse, it’s time to face Cedar; it’s time to face Emmeline."

    wan "Here goes nothing…"

    #fade out
    
    #"I happen upon a journal entry, worn and ragged, that I've read many times since it had been written: Winter, 1967. I close the journal, quickly, a pained expression on my face."

    #"I shouldn't be tempting fate like this. I've read it enough over the years, always a strange, new feeling growing with each and every recalled memory."

    #"We once again begin to move towards my destination. Traffic seems to have given way to open fields and rolling hills. Despite this, my mind is yet again drawn back to that journal entry."

    #"That fateful winter night, I had met a most wondrous woman. She's plagued my dreams for decades at this point, and yet I always told myself that I could never go back."

    #"My one fear, though, had been clear to be true: I regret everything."

    #"I regret meeting her. I regret talking to her. I regret taking her out, into the snow, like young children exploring their fleeting youth."

    #"I regret leaving her, despite the impossibility of it all."

    #"I still remember her face, her voice, every bit about her. Despite my old age, my mind is and always will be sharp as ever."

    #"I wonder… will she remember me?"

    #"The truck takes a detour down a long and green path. In the distance, the familiar sign stares back at me, welcoming me: CEDAR, MAINE: POPULATION 2,501."

    #"I let the trucker know that he can drop me off here. I need to hike the rest of the way on my own. With a proper nod, I depart, and he drives back, along his own path."

    "With a deep breath and a sigh, I walk towards the bar that I had come to love. Nature makes way to buildings, denser and closer, until I'm nearly in the heart of the small town, a familiar entrance in front of me."

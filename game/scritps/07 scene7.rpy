    "June 13, 1987"

    "Another day, another highway stretches out towards Oblivion, USA as I stand beside it, outstretched arm, erected thumb, baking in the heat of the mid-June sun like a scrambled egg served sunny side-up over asphalt."

    "Route 1 to be exact, some meaningless measure of distance from Caribou. These old Maine roads are so familiar, painfully so, that I attempt to suspend my awareness of them as I walk from one town to the next." 
    
    "Too many memories spanning too many years. I’m growing tired; mentally, physically, spiritually—hell, every which way a man can grow weary." 

    "But still, year after year I walk these same old roads. Maybe one day I’ll just stop dead cold in my tracks, and the good Lord’ll allow me to finally rest on some dusty trail in the middle of nowhere."

    "Perhaps they’ll even name it after me… that wouldn’t be so bad, being memorialized for future generations of ramblers like myself."
    
    "But now I can’t walk anymore; it’s been hours since I left Caribou and I’ve gotta piss like there’s no tomorrow."

    "I issue a prayer under my breath."
    
    "Why? I don’t know, as there’s surely no one out here to hear it but myself." 

    "I hope that some friendly stranger with a penchant for helping other friendly strangers might notice my hiked thumb and offer me a lift to the next town."

    "My prayer is soon answered in the form of an eighteen-wheeler. Zimmerman Trucking Co., if I can correctly decipher the eroded letters emblazoned on the side of the truck."
    
    "Its driver leans over the passenger seat and struggles for several moments to get the window to roll down, but to little avail. This truck has clearly seen better days." 

    "One exasperated grunt later, he accepts that his passenger-side window will not budge down further than a crack." 

    "Fortunately this is just enough of an opening for him to be able to shout and be heard above the rumble and sputter of his idling engine."

    tru "Hey man, where ya headed?!"

    wan "Anywhere’s fine so long as I can get out of this heat!"

    "A moment later the truck’s passenger-side door swings open, and I gratefully climb up into the well air-conditioned cab."
    
    "The interior smells of cigarettes, whiskey, and grease, each scent hitting me in turn as I buckle myself in; it’s nostalgic, though it really shouldn’t be."

    "The driver, all slender and short and clean-shaven, the very opposite of the big, burly type that you always imagine drive big rigs for a living, thrusts a hand in my direction, which I take and shake firmly."

    tru "So anywhere’s fine, eh?"

    "His shortened ‘o’ sound and use of ‘eh’ places his origin somewhere in the Midwest, probably Minnesota, but there’s a foreign element to it, almost a southern twang."

    wan "Yessir, and I do thank you for the lift. A moment longer out there and I’d likely have succumbed to a heat stroke… or worse."

    tru "Worse?"

    wan "Melting."

    tru "Ha! Yeah man, it sure is a scorcher, isn’t it? Highest temperature on record for this region, or so the weatherman said on the radio this morning."

    tru "Global warming is what they’re calling it."

    tru "I don’t know about all that, but I do know it sure ain’t the right weather for hitch-hiking."

    wan "You can say that again."

    tru "Anyway, this old rig’s heading up to St. Leonard, but you just let me know if you wanna be dropped off anywhere  along the way." 

    tru "Not that there’s much to speak of between here and there, haha."

    wan "Nah, Canada is fine. In fact, anywhere’s better than…"

    "I pause to consider just where the hell I am. This ribbon of highway which leads north out of Caribou just meanders through unincorporated countryside, really."

    "Grassy plains and clusters of trees everywhere you look. A short distance away I spy a small farm that wasn’t there a decade ago."

    "An old man is listlessly riding a lawnmower over well-trimmed grass. What else can he do to kill these mid-afternoon hours when everything is so hot and dry and dead?"

    wan "...nowhere, I guess."

    "The man laughs and shifts the truck into gear, and soon we’re headed down Route 1, with only the radio to take my mind off of how full my bladder is."

    "It's tuned to some political program wherein two pundits are taking turns yelling lies at each other about Gorbachev and democracy."

    "A more unprincipled man might’ve taken a leak somewhere off the side of the road, but I could never do a thing like that." 

    "This land, with its deserts and trees and beaches and skyscrapers and hippie communes, is my land; the highways that are etched into its face are collectively my temple, and I am its high priest."

    "To wantonly piss on this holy ground would be no less than sacrilege."

    "(Innermost convictions be damned, though, if we don’t reach a truck stop or rest area soon. I would rather pee on a bush than myself.)"

    "On the radio there’s a lull in the heated discourse as one of the hosts segues into some recent soundbite of the President speaking."

    "{i}...across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth.{/i}"
    
    "The trucker’s interest appears piqued as he turns up the volume and listens intently."

    "{i}General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate.{/i}"

    "{i}Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall {/i}"

    "Old Gipper couldn’t outact a chimp, but he can sure put an end to communism, yessirree."

    "The driver soon loses interest as the program segues out of Reagan’s spiel and back to the two goofballs arguing about Gorbachev, and he begins to scan through whatever radio stations can be caught this far into Aroostook County."

    tru "Any preference?"

    "I let him skip through various rock and roll oldies stations before giving him the nod to stop the dial on Hank Williams’ ‘Lovesick Blues’."

    "I’m not the biggest country music fan, but listening to the Hillbilly Shakespeare wax poetic about being nobody’s sugar daddy anymore proves to be a pleasant enough distraction—at least until my trucking friend joins in with his own nasally intonations."

    "Fortunately a Texaco soon appears, and I’m spared the displeasure of hearing him butcher the rest of the tune as he pull in near the closest pump and steps outside to refuel."

    "As for me, I hasten to avail myself of the gas station’s public restroom. I purchase a cinnamon danish and an 8 oz. cup of coffee on my way out, and then it’s back on the road we go."

    "The danish is dry and crumbly—don’t know what I expected for 50 cents, to tell the truth—but the coffee is good, and I nurse it as I begin to ponder what I’ll do when I reach St. Leonard."

    scene highway with fade

    "There’s something about the flavor of cheap roadside coffee that’s intoxicating to the tired mind. Pretty soon I can feel my spirits begin to lift as my imagination runs amok thinking up adventures that might await me in St. Leonard."

    "This won’t be my first time in Canada, far from it, of course, but for whatever reason I’ve avoided seeing Quebec till now."

    "Maybe it’s because I don’t speak a damn lick of French, but then again, language barriers never kept me from having a little fun in the French Quarter either."

    "A passing mile marker reads 2,305. It won’t be too long now until we reach the border and I can begin a new life in a new town with a new job…" 

    "All for about two weeks before I have to move on and do the same old song and dance someplace else. I’m not complaining—because again, I’ve never been to French-speaking Canada."

    "St. Leonard will do me good. ...or so I’d like to believe."

    "But that honest part of me that I’ve become so adept at suppressing is nagging at my brain, reminding me in no subtle tone that there’s more between here and there than just open road."

    "An old, familiar ache suddenly reawakens as I gaze into the shallow pool of java that sits at the bottom of my cup. In the swirling pools of ochre I can see visions of a girl I once met, hallucinations of her chestnut hair wisping in the light winter breeze."

    "What possessed me to walk this way? What else did I think would come of going back to Maine? Not enough time has passed to dull my lingering sense of regret."

    "I mean, hell, twenty years is a long, long time… but in my life? That’s not long enough to exorcise the ghost of a single night."

    "It was the sort of night that never leaves you; even as a memory, it visits you in the evening when you’re trying to be quiet, trying to rest. It plays tricks on your mind, summoning apparitions from out of nowhere."

    "Even now, visions of that girl come to me when I least expect them; just when I think I’m ready to cancel all debts to my past self and press onward for once and for good, that’s when she comes to me."

    "These visions conquer my mind. They keep me coming back to old roads and old towns in hopes of seeing her again—even though I’m certain she wouldn’t remember me."

    "The truck suddenly jerks to a halt, causing the puddle of coffee I was just fixated on to splash in my face, putting a premature end to my sad, nostalgic spell."

    tru "Jesus, man, I’m so sorry! Are you alright?"

    wan "It was lukewarm anyway, so I’m cool. What’s happening?"

    "The man gestures beyond the windshield and I see a long stretch of cars ahead and beyond that, an accident of some sort. State trooper lights flash in the distance."

    "Seems they’re allowing only a few vehicles at a time to cautiously maneuver around the wreckage, and we’re the new end-of-the-line."

    "Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes slowly drip by, and in that time we’ve scarcely budged. Finally the fellow seated beside me lets out an exasperated sigh and reaches over to my side of the cab in order to fish something from out the glove compartment; I scoot my legs back to give him more room to sort through the stacks of loose tools and booklets."

    "After replacing a manual and a set of grease-stained gloves his bandaged hand at last returns with a well-worn copy of The Complete Works of Allen Ginsberg. Cat’s got taste."

    "As he slips on a pair of reading glasses and opens to some latter bookmarked page, I decide to whittle away the time with a book of a different kind: my journal. Reaching into the front compartment of my backpack, I remove the latest draft of my voluminous travelogue."

    "I like to think that one day this journal will be published to great acclaim, but as a work of fiction; Lord knows I’ve experienced too much crazy shit over the course of too many decades for anyone to buy into the veracity of its contents."

    "Then, some years afterward, it’ll be adapted to the silver screen as a musical buddy comedy starring Steve Martin and Dan Ackroyd. Kevin Bacon will cameo as yours truly. It’ll be mad fun, and it will all happen long after I finally decide to give up on this running joke of a life."

    "With a wistful sigh I open the record book of my eternal life on the road. There has got to be something in here that will pull me out of this funk and resuscitate those optimistic feelings I had but fifteen minutes ago. I begin flipping to random entries in search of what whatever that might be."

    #Wolf's part of scene 1

    "I happen upon a journal entry, worn and ragged, that I've read many times since it had been written: Winter, 1967. I close the journal, quickly, a pained expression on my face."

    "I shouldn't be tempting fate like this. I've read it enough over the years, always a strange, new feeling growing with each and every recalled memory."

    "We once again begin to move towards my destination. Traffic seems to have given way to open fields and rolling hills. Despite this, my mind is yet again drawn back to that journal entry."

    "That fateful winter night, I had met a most wondrous woman. She's plagued my dreams for decades at this point, and yet I always told myself that I could never go back."

    "My one fear, though, had been clear to be true: I regret everything."

    "I regret meeting her. I regret talking to her. I regret taking her out, into the snow, like young children exploring their fleeting youth."

    "I regret leaving her, despite the impossibility of it all."

    "I still remember her face, her voice, every bit about her. Despite my old age, my mind is and always will be sharp as ever."

    "I wonder… will she remember me?"

    "The truck takes a detour down a long and green path. In the distance, the familiar sign stares back at me, welcoming me: CEDAR, MAINE: POPULATION 2,501."

    "I let the trucker know that he can drop me off here. I need to hike the rest of the way on my own. With a proper nod, I depart, and he drives back, along his own path."

    "With a deep breath and a sigh, I walk towards the bar that I had come to love. Nature makes way to buildings, denser and closer, until I'm nearly in the heart of the small town, a familiar entrance in front of me."

    "A gentle silence fills the air between us as he hands me the beer and I take a sip, clearing my throat."

    wan "I'm not sure if you will be able to help me, but I have a favor to ask."

    ten "Shoot."

    wan "Last time I happened my way into this bar, do you remember the charming girl in green? Her voice was enchanting, one of a kind, really. What ever happened to her?"

    ten "Emmeline? Well, luck would have it, she still lives here in Cedar, working in this very bar."

    "My eyes light up with this very, very good news. She's still here, even after all this time? I can hardly believe it."

    ten "Yeah, she lives just down the road, with her husband and young boy."

    "I feel… crushed. I'm not sure what I was expecting, really, but it hurts nonetheless."

    "The bartender must've caught on, as he continues."

    ten "Does this change anything? I assume you had something in mind."

    wan "While it should… it doesn't, really. I'm not entirely sure what I would have done, anyhow. Would it be wrong of me to ask of an address?"

    ten "While I would give it to you regardless, it's not necessary. She comes by every morning with her son to help set up for the day. You should come again, tomorrow, as I assume you are planning to stay for a while?"

    wan "Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks, really. It means a lot."

    ten "Don't mention it. Anything for an old friend."

    "With that, I sip my beer and think of the coming events. The fear that she won't recognize me once again crosses my mind, but I push it off in search of a bed to lay my head."

    "I nod to the bartender, and make my way to a local motel to rest up for the night."

    "We find a bench overlooking the hillside. I wipe the snow off it with the sleeve of my coat. We sit down close to each other for warmth."

    "Emmeline pulls herself even closer to me, tugging at my arm. She leans her head on my shoulder and shuts her eyes."

    emm "You don't mind, do you?"

    emm "I'm so tired."

    emm "I think I'll rest my eyes for a while until the sunrise starts."

    wan "It's fine. I think I'll do the same thing."

    "I close my eyes and rest my thoughts."

    "...It's been a wild night."

    "And I'm so tired."

    wan "..."

    emm "..."

    emm "..."

    wan "Hey, Emmeline."

    emm "Yeah?"

    wan "I'm going to tell you a story. It's a short story, but it's a complicated one. It's an important one. At the end of the story, you're going to have to decide what happens next. I want you to be completely honest with me when I ask you to do that."

    wan "Alright?"

    "Emmeline yawns."

    emm "...Alright."

    wan "Alright."

    "I hope I'm making the right choice here."

    "How do I even begin to explain..."

    wan "Say, in the world, there's a young man out there who's been given the gift of eternal youth."

    wan "At first, that young man was amazed. He was filled with joy. He was forever young, forever handsome, and forever strong. The passage of time had no effect on him. It didn't chip away at him like it did everyone else he knew."

    wan "He spent some time loving this new life of his, until he realized that the gift he'd been given was, in the end, a curse."

    wan "Eventually, the young man saw what the passage of time could really do."

    wan "He saw all the people he cared about wither away, one by one. Family, friends, lovers... he could have done nothing but watch as each and every one of them fell into the grip of death from which he had been spared."

    wan "He saw the places he knew as a child crumble into dust, forgotten, thrown away like false memories. First he lost his home, then his people, then his own way of life."

    wan "He was forced to escape. To break out and enter into a new world where he did not belong. He felt lost, in that new world. Hopeless. Alone. Forgotten."

    wan "But eventually, he got used to it. He realized there wasn't any point in wallowing in despair at the life he's been given, and so he started to rebuild. He gave himself a new life. A new identity."

    wan "But he lived knowing that there was one thing he never could do. He could never stay in one place for too long. If he did, he knew he would build bonds."

    wan "He would form memories. With the new places he found and the new people he met. He would make friends. He would feel emotions all over again, in all their full intensity."

    wan "And that was something he could not afford. Because he knew any bond he built would come only crashing down upon him in the end."

    wan "The more people he came to know, the more people whose departures would hurt him. The more time he spent in any one place in the world, the more pain he was damning himself to suffer. He was truly cursed."

    wan "All he could do was run. Run farther, and farther, and farther, as far as he could go toward infinity."

    wan "As long as time continued to pass, he suffered the life of a wanderer destined to be alone."

    wan "But one night, he meets someone."

    wan "And that someone makes him feel some way he has not felt since before his journey ever began."

    wan "Someone special. Someone like him, who understood him, who felt his pain. Who knew how it felt to endure."

    wan "He thinks he's found someone that could teach him how to love again."

    wan "But he knows if he stays there with that person he's found, he will only hurt them in the end."

    wan "Because if he stays with that someone, they will age, and he will not."

    wan "They will die, and he will not."
    
    wan "And in his failure to die, he would rob them their chance at a normal life. He would take their life as his own and, in the end..."

    wan "...he will find himself all alone again."

    wan "What does he do, then?"

    wan "What choice does he make?"

    wan "Does he stay, or does he leave?"

    wan "Does he chase that chance at true emotion, even if the knows in the end it will cause only despair?"

    "I open my eyes."

    "I see the sun has begun to rise."

    "To my side, Emmeline is fast asleep."

    "I take a long, final look at her."

    "She's so beautiful."

    "Her heartbeat pulses through her skin, through her dress, through her coat, through all the way to me. I can feel it drum steadily against me. I can feel it throb, over and over again, full of such amazing life."

    "I watch her, her breath freezing as it comes out in the crisp, cold air. Her skin is soft and warm to the touch. I think of her, and how she treated me — a stranger, who hadn't even told her his name — with nothing but kindness."

    "This is a real person beside me. With a real heart, pumping real blood. With real emotions, and real thoughts, and the most beautiful voice I've ever heard in my life."

    "This is Emmeline."

    "And no matter how greatly I long to be with her..."

    "I cannot stay with her, and she cannot stay with me."

    "It was never meant to be."

    "I stand up carefully, holding her still to make sure she doesn't wake up. Once I'm off the bench, I set her down to be as comfortable as I can make her."

    "Thankfully, it's warming up, and I think she'll wake up soon after I leave. Just in case, I take off my coat and wrap it around her to make sure she's warm enough."

    "I glance at the sunrise out on the horizon."

    "I can't bear to look at it too long."

    "I turn back gaze at her one last time."

    "The girl in the green dress, sleeping on the park bench."

    "If only things had been different."

    "Then ."

    "I begin to walk away."

    "I stop myself from looking back."

    wan "Emmeline..."

    wan "...I'm sorry."

    wan "Goodbye."

    "I walk away into wilderness as the sun rises over the trees."

    "I vanish like a ghost from a dream, wiping tears from my eyes."

    "All I leave behind are footprints in the snow that are soon swept away by winter wind."

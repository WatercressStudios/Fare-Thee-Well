    wan "I take it there aren't too many new opportunities to talk to people here in Cedar?"

    emm "Not here, no."

    wan "Can I ask how you ended up here?"

    emm "You could, but it's not a fun story. You can imagine my parents weren't very big fans of my expulsion."

    wan "I figured."

    emm "They were livid. Engorged with rage. You'd think they were going to eat me, they were so angry."

    emm "Like they were going to lock me up in the cellar and bury the key."

    "While she's talking, her voice becomes strained. Obviously this is reopening old wounds for her. I feel bad for bringing it up now."

    emm "They started pressuring me to find a husband. Showed me off to any rich young men or family friends who came by, trying to convince me to give myself up and marry a complete stranger."

    emm "Made me feel like I was a hunk of meat being peddled in some marketplace. To them, my failure had branded me a commodity. I'd become a damaged good."

    emm "Something to be sold off, my value to be measured in nothing but the children I would bear."

    emm "I couldn't take it. I absolutely couldn't live like that."

    wan "So you took off?"

    emm "You could tell?"
    
    wan "You seem the type."

    "This makes Emmeline loosen up again, but only a little. That's good. I have to try and help her feel better. I hope I didn't spoil her night."

    emm "I'll go ahead and take that as a compliment."

    wan "Good. It was meant as one."

    wan "..."

    wan "I hadn't meant to bring up bad memories."

    emm "Like I said, it's fine. It's nice to finally be able to talk to someone about it. It's all been bottled up so long."

    emm "Well, the rest is a lot of the same."

    emm "I packed up some clothes and some books and snuck out in the middle of the night."

    emm "I stayed in the city a while, with friends and the like. Figured it was the safest way. After sometime though, I knew I had to get farther away than that. Somewhere my parents wouldn't find me."

    emm "So I ran. Wandered from place to place. Took cabs and buses when I could, walked when I couldn't. Hitchhiked when I absolutely needed to."

    emm "It wasn't too safe and as a girl, I had to be careful. But I was smart. I kept my eyes open and it's taken me this far."

    wan "How far is 'this far?'"

    emm "Far enough."

    wan "But?"
    
    emm "I don't know."

    emm "I called my parents a few times, just to let them know I was still alive. I'm a good girl like that."

    emm "At first, they were even more furious than they'd been while I was at home. They threatened to call the police after me. Threatened me when I said I wouldn't come home."

    emm "But after some time, as I got farther and farther from home, as I was gone for longer and longer? They started to soften up."

    emm "Hot rage turned to bold resentment. Resentment turned to disappointment. Disappointment turned to sadness. Turned to regret. Turned to apology..."

    emm "...turned to them begging me to come home."

    "Emmeline looked visibly shaken."

    "I felt so bad for her."

    "But I knew how she felt, and I knew I had to let her finish."

    emm "..."

    emm "It's been more than two years since I left home."

    emm "They started begging by the end of the first year. I couldn't take it, so I stopped calling them."

    emm "I haven't spoken to them since."

    "Emmeline gazes into her reflection caught on the polish of her empty glass, warm under the dim bar lights."

    "The night has gone on and many have left. Everything's quieter now."

    "Everything is moving softer, going slower, like the night has entered into a dreamlike state."

    "I place a hand on Emmeline's shoulder softly. I want to comfort her."

    wan "You don't want to go home?"

    emm "No, I do. Believe me. This sort of life gets tiring after a while. Having no safety, no security. Always needing to move from place to place. Searching for warmth every single night and praying every single morning you'll be able to find work and to feed yourself..."

    emm "It drains you. It takes a lot away and it makes you lose your sense of place."

    emm "When you can't ever stay in one place too long, it feels like everything in your life has a time limit set on it. It ticks away, and it couldn't care less about what you want. The time runs out, and one by one, everything in your life melts away."

    emm "The people you meet, the things you gain, the sights you see. They leave, and you're left with nothing again."

    emm "And do you know what you do then?"

    wan "Yeah."

    wan "You start over. You feel like you don't have any control over anything, like you're not even the person living your life. You feel like you're only sitting back and watching events unfold. Like you're an observer from the outside, looking in on yourself."

    emm "I just... can't go home."

    emm "I don't have it in me to go home."

    wan "You're afraid of what will happen if you do?"

    emm "I'm beyond afraid. I'm petrified. I can't even breathe right when I think about seeing my parents again. Even though this journey's taken so much away from me, I feel like just giving up and returning home isn't going to give me any of that back."

    emm "It isn't."

    emm "I feel like, if I want to get back everything that's been drained out of me, I need to find something."

    emm "I don't know what, just that it's something I'm searching for."

    emm "And if I find it, I can go back and live a normal life again."

    "Emmeline sighs."

    emm "...If any of that makes sense to you."

    emm "Don't worry, I know you're like me."

    emm "I don't know if I knew before we started talking, but I definitely know now. I think that's why I've told you so much about myself."
    
    emm "I've never spoken so much about myself before. Not to anyone. Not in my whole life. I've never spoken much at all, really."

    "So I've heard."

    emm "So that's alright. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Consider it an apology for me spending the last hour talking about nothing but myself. I'm sorry for that."

    "I dismiss her with a wave."

    wan "Really, it's fine. I don't think I've ever talked to anyone like this either. And I'm glad I could help you finally open up about these things."

    "Emmeline beams."

    emm "Mhm."

    "I laughed."

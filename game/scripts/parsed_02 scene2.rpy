    "I've never been this absorbed in song before."

    "The voice of the girl in the green dress grows, and grows, and grows, only to fill the air with complete emotion, feelings seething with energy."

    "Her skin beads with sweat. Her chest heaves up and down to the rhythmic beat of her exhausted heart."

    "Her posture is tired, but proud. Her breath short, but steady. Her eyes somber, but bright, vibrant with fire."

    "And as I watch her, in this precious little moment of silence, it seems all time stops."

    "The sheer intensity of this moment breaks over me like a cold ocean wave. The sadness I feel at its impermanence — its immediate beginning and end — pulls me under."

    "I am washed in fascination, and in that moment, the passage of time resumes. It flows unhindered, ignorant that so much change had just taken place in my inner self in that brief window of frozen time."

    "That change in my heart has just set forth in motion a long, long story."

    "One that will not end for a very long time."

    "A story about meeting people, and saying goodbye to people."

    "A story about arrivals and departures."

    "A story about time."

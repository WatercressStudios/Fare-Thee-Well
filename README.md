# Fare-Thee-Well
Our Entry for NaNoReNo 2015 Visual Novel Jam

"A short, kinetic visual novel set on the Canadian border during the years 1967, 1987, and 2002. Heavily inspired by traditional folk music, each act of the plot is named after and dedicated to a beloved folk song. The character-heavy story will focus on the theme of the beauty and tragedy of the passage of time.

This will be our team's second entry into the NaNoRenO celebration after last year's Palinurus: The Ocean of Stars (http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=31434).
